  <h2>Conformance requirements</h2>

  <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
  non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
  Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", <!--"SHALL", "SHALL
  NOT",--> "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be
  interpreted as described in RFC2119. For readability, these words do
  not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification. <a
  href="#refsRFC2119">[RFC2119]</a></p>

  <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms
  (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and
  abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
  key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the
  algorithm.</p>

  <p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on
  attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements are to be
  interpreted as requirements on user agents.</p>

  <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
  may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
  equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
  specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to
  be performant.)</p>

  <p>The only conformance class defined by this specification is user
  agents.</p>

  <p>User agents may impose implementation-specific limits on
  otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g. to prevent denial of service
  attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work around
  platform-specific limitations.</p>

  <p>When support for a feature is disabled (e.g. as an emergency
  measure to mitigate a security problem, or to aid in development, or
  for performance reasons), user agents must act as if they had no
  support for the feature whatsoever, and as if the feature was not
  mentioned in this specification. For example, if a particular
  feature is accessed via an attribute in a Web IDL interface, the
  attribute itself would be omitted from the objects that implement
  that interface &mdash; leaving the attribute on the object but
  making it return null or throw an exception is insufficient.</p>


  <h3>Dependencies</h3>

  <p>This specification relies on several other underlying
  specifications.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>HTML</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Many fundamental concepts from HTML are used by this
    specification. <a href="#refsHTML">[HTML]</a></p>

   </dd>

   <dt>WebIDL</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>The IDL blocks in this specification use the semantics of the
    WebIDL specification. <a href="#refsWEBIDL">[WEBIDL]</a></p>

  <h2>Terminology</h2>

  <p>The construction "a <code title="">Foo</code> object", where
  <code title="">Foo</code> is actually an interface, is sometimes
  used instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the
  interface <code title="">Foo</code>".</p>

  <p>The term DOM is used to refer to the API set made available to
  scripts in Web applications, and does not necessarily imply the
  existence of an actual <code>Document</code> object or of any other
  <code>Node</code> objects as defined in the DOM Core
  specifications. <a href="#refsDOMCORE">[DOMCORE]</a></p>

  <p>An IDL attribute is said to be <em>getting</em> when its value is
  being retrieved (e.g. by author script), and is said to be
  <em>setting</em> when a new value is assigned to it.</p>
